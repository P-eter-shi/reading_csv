##📝 Description:
   This project analyzes a COVID-19 dataset containing global case records (confirmed, deaths, recovered) across different regions. The goal is to explore trends, compare countries, and visualize key metrics using pandas for data manipulation and matplotlib for visualizations.
##🎯Objectives:
       1.Load and clean the dataset, handling missing values.
       2.Explore trends in confirmed cases,deaths,and recoveries.
       3.Compare countries with highest case counts.
       4.Visualize distributions and relationships between variables.
       5.Calculate recovery rates over time to assess pandemic progression.
🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
